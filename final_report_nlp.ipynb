    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our goal is to create a classification model to predict programming languages using Readme content from GitHub repositories.\n",
    "    - This can assist users in finding relevant content based on their programming language critera.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most common programming language found in our dataset is Javascript followed by Python\n",
    "- Some of the most common words in Readmes were found to be: 'file', 'end', 'class','use' and 'object'.\n",
    "- The length of the readme's varies by programming languages.\n",
    "- \n",
    "- Our best model used  to predict programming languages with % accuracy. This model outperformed my baseline score of % accuracy, so it has value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trello board used to identify the different tasks for this project. You can find the board <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/PddXdOTJ/nlp-project\">here</a>\n",
    "- Python scripts were used to acquire, prepare and explore the data\n",
    "- \n",
    "- Statistical analyses tested the following hypotheses:\n",
    "    1. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dictionary detailing all variables utilized in this analyses can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/mariam-and-cindy/predicting-programming-languages/blob/main/README.md\">here</a>."
